```
/faction list 
/faction add [player]
/faction create [name] [color]
/faction rank [player] [co-owner, mod, default]
/faction (shows faction name, balance and members)
/faction deposit [money]
/faction disband
/faction chat
/faction claim (highlights on dynmap)
/faction war (only works with leaders+ placeholder api so everyone can see what factions are in war also when a faction is in a war with the other they can break eachothers claims)
Chat:
[Star Icon for Leaders] [Faction + Color] [Playername]

Owners can do everything kick etc, co-owners everything except disband, mods kick players claim land and deposit , default can only deposit.

leaders can and once it happens there will be an announcement and will popup on the scoreboard (placeholder api) once factions are in war they can grief each other's claims (breaking blocks)
